# Introduction #

So we know how to program with the USBASP programmer, lets learn how to use it with the Arduino.


# Details #

I will type up instructions a little bit later, for right now take a look at this video. It walks you through from beginning (what you need, creating the circuit on a bread board and arduino, and then using AVRDUDE to program the chip)

If for some reason the video isn't showing up embedded, here is the link for it http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tBz23URW4A
